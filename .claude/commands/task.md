Create a GitHub task issue draft in markdown format based on the context provided.

The task topic or description is: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Step 1 — Gather context

Run these commands in parallel to build context:

/tasread `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/6.task.yml` so you know the exact field labels.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, infer the task title and domain from the branch name and recent commit messages.

---

## Step 2 — Draft the issue

Using the gathered context, write a complete task issue in GitHub Markdown. Follow the structure below exactly — use the same section headings as the template (`Task Description ✏️`, `Acceptance Criteria ✅`, etc.).

Guidelines for each section:

**Title** — action-oriented, starts with a verb, e.g. "Implement Box component" or "Migrate API auth to JWT". Prepend `[Task]` internally but do NOT include it in the `## Title` line of the output.

**Task Description ✏️**

- 2–4 sentences: what is being built/changed, why it matters, which epic or story it belongs to (reference issue number if inferable from context).
- Be concrete — mention the component, module, or area being touched.

**Acceptance Criteria ✅**

- One checkbox per verifiable condition.
- Cover: implementation, props/API, edge cases, tests (unit + Storybook if relevant), lint/types/CI.
- Match the granularity of the Avatar example — each item should be independently testable.

**Dependencies 🔗**

- List blocking issues/PRs by number or name, or write `_No response_` if none.

**Definition of Ready (DoR) 📋**

- Bullet list of what must be true before work starts (approach agreed, tokens available, API contract stable, etc.).

**Definition of Done (DoD) 🏁**

- Checkbox list mirroring Acceptance Criteria at a higher level: component working, tests green, stories present, code reviewed, docs updated, CI passing.

**Additional Notes or Resources 📎**

- Relevant MDN links, design references, prior art in the codebase, or usage examples.
- If nothing applies, write `_No response_`.

---

## Step 3 — Output the draft

Print the full issue content to the conversation in a single markdown code block so the user can copy and paste it directly into GitHub's new-issue form under the **Task 🛠️** template.

Do not write any files.
