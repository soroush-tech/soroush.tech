# `ci.yml` — Continuous Integration

Single CI workflow for the whole monorepo. A `prepare` job detects everything once,
then change-gated jobs fan out from it. `ci-ok` is the single status check used for
branch protection.

```yaml
on:
  push: { branches: [main] }
  pull_request:
permissions: { contents: read }
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true # supersede stale runs on the same ref
```

| Field       | Value                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Triggers    | `push` to `main`, every `pull_request`                         |
| Permissions | `contents: read` (least privilege; jobs that need more opt in) |
| Concurrency | one run per `workflow + ref`; in-progress runs are cancelled   |

## Job graph

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    prepare --> lint
    lint --> packages
    lint --> worker
    lint --> web
    prepare --> packages
    prepare --> worker
    prepare --> web
    prepare --> ciok["ci-ok"]
    lint --> ciok
    packages --> ciok
    worker --> ciok
    web --> ciok
```

`packages`, `worker`, and `web` only run when their area changed (see
[`prepare`](#job-prepare)). `ci-ok` runs `if: always()` so it can turn skips into a
pass and real failures into a fail.

## Job: `prepare`

`runs-on: ubuntu-latest` · `timeout-minutes: 15`. Produces every output the other
jobs consume via `needs.prepare.outputs.*`.

Fails if none found.                                                                                                                        |
| 4   | Read Playwright version     | `node -p "...devDependencies?.['@playwright/test'] \|\| ...dependencies?.['@playwright/test']"` then strip leading `^` | Feeds the Playwright binary cache key. **Must read `@playwright/test`** — the project has no bare `playwright` dep, so reading `playwright` yields the string `"undefined"` and freezes the cache key (see [Caching](#caching)).           |
| 5   | Discover workspace entities | inline `node` script over `apps/*`, `workers/*`, `packages/*`, `.github/workflows/*`                                   | Builds a per-entity `paths-filter` config: one key per app (`app__<name>`), worker (`worker__<name>`), package (`pkg__<name>`), and workflow file (`wf__<name>`), plus `root` (`['*', '.*']`, top-level files only).                       |

A `root` or workflow change counts as infra → validates the whole workspace. |
| 8   | Upload `changes.json`       | `actions/upload-artifact@v7` (name `changes`)                                                                          | Hands the single file to the CD workflows, which run on `workflow_run` and have no diff base of their own.                                                                                                                                 |

| `has_packages`                   | `'true'` when ≥1 package (or infra) changed                                       |
| `changed_packages`               | `fromJSON`-ready matrix `{include:[{dir,filter,flag}]}` for the CI `packages` job |

### `changes.json`

The single artifact the CD workflows consume. `apps` / `worker` / `packages` /
`workflows` are **lists of the changed names** (empty when nothing changed); `root`
is a **boolean** (a top-level file changed). No `dir`/`filter`/`flag` — a name is
enough; each CD applies its own [condition](./cd-web.md#job-changes).

```json
{
  "apps": ["web"],
  "worker": ["api"],
  "packages": ["schema", "eslint-config"],
  "workflows": ["ci", "cd-web"],
  "root": false
}
```

## Job: `lint`

`needs: prepare` · ubuntu · 15 min. Lint + typecheck the whole workspace once
(`pnpm -r` skips workspaces without the script). Not change-gated — it's cheap.

## Job: `web`

`needs: [prepare, lint]` · `if: web == 'true'` · `environment: CI` · 30 min. The only
multi-OS job.

`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` is pinned so one cache path/key works on every OS (the
default download location differs per platform).

Each engine runs on its native OS; macOS (≈10× cost) is reserved for WebKit. E2E
runs read `VITE_BASE_URL` from repo `vars`.

## Job: `ci-ok`

`if: always()` · `needs: [prepare, lint, packages, worker, web]` · ubuntu · 5 min.
The single required check for branch protection.

```yaml
- if: contains(needs.*.result, 'failure') || contains(needs.*.result, 'cancelled')
  run: exit 1
```

Skipped change-gated jobs report `skipped` (not `failure`/`cancelled`), so a
package-only PR still passes `ci-ok` without the web suite ever running.

## Caching

Two independent caches; both are keyed so a real change busts them.

### 1. Dependency store (`actions/setup-node`)

Every job that installs uses `setup-node@v5` with `cache: ${{ … manager }}`. For
pnpm this caches the **pnpm store**, keyed automatically off the `pnpm-lock.yaml`
hash. A lockfile change → new key → fresh install; otherwise the store is restored
and `--frozen-lockfile` just links.

### 2. Playwright browser binaries (`web` job only)

```yaml
env:
  PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/ms-playwright
# restore (before install)
- uses: actions/cache/restore@v5
  id: playwright-cache
  with:
    path: ${{ github.workspace }}/ms-playwright
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-playwright-${{ needs.prepare.outputs.playwright_version }}
# … install deps, then `playwright install --with-deps` …
# save (only on a miss, even if later steps fail)
- uses: actions/cache/save@v5
  if: always() && steps.playwright-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
  with:
    path: ${{ github.workspace }}/ms-playwright
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-playwright-${{ needs.prepare.outputs.playwright_version }}
```

Why the **restore/save split** instead of a single `actions/cache`:

- `playwright install --with-deps` always runs (it's idempotent and also installs OS
  deps), so binaries are correct whether the cache hit or missed.
- `save` runs only on a miss (`cache-hit != 'true'`) and with `if: always()`, so a
  freshly downloaded set is persisted even if a later test step fails.

**Key correctness:** the key embeds `playwright_version`. That value comes from
`prepare` reading `@playwright/test` — the package actually in `apps/web/package.json`.
Reading a bare `playwright` (absent) returns `"undefined"`, which pins the key to
`<os>-playwright-undefined` forever: after the first save it always hits, so a
Playwright upgrade silently reuses stale browser binaries. Keying on the real version
makes an upgrade produce a new key and a fresh download.
