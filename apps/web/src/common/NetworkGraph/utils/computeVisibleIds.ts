 *    only *active* areas (those in `expandedNodes`) reveal children. A central root is
 *    shown too when one is present (i.e. `adjacency` has a `rootId` entry). Descent follows the expand rule — an active area reveals its direct
 *    children, a branch reveals its own only once expanded too — and a child appears
 *    only if its area gate (`areasByNode`) intersects the active areas. (Edges to an
 *    inactive area are dropped by the renderer so a shared node keeps a line only to
 *    the areas that are on.)
 *  - **Default**: root + areas shown; expanding a branch reveals its direct children
 *    (generic graphs that drill down level by level).
 *
 *  `hiddenIds` are skipped entirely, so a hidden node hides its subtree too. */
